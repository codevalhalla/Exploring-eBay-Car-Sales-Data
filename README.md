# Data Analysis: Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

Welcome to the repository for my data analysis project - "Exploring eBay Car Sales Data." In this project, I delve into a comprehensive dataset of used car listings from *eBay Kleinanzeigen*, the classifieds section of the German eBay website. Through meticulous data cleaning and insightful analysis, I uncover valuable trends and insights within the used car market.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to cleanse the provided dataset and unearth meaningful insights that can inform both buyers and sellers in the used car market. By identifying patterns in prices, brands, and other key attributes, this analysis contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics driving the used car economy.

## Key Insights

1. **Temporal Patterns**: The dataset's temporal distribution indicates consistent crawling activity over a span of one month. This pattern underscores the consistent availability of fresh listings.

2. **Price Variation**: An exploration of vehicle prices reveals a diverse range of listings. While certain listings boast unrealistic prices, most fall within reasonable ranges.

3. **Mileage Analysis**: Odometer readings, a crucial indicator of vehicle usage, display a fascinating trend. A preponderance of listings exhibits mileage figures rounded to certain thresholds, possibly due to predefined options during listing.

4. **Brands and Value**: The data unveils varying price ranges among car brands. German manufacturers like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes Benz command premium prices, while Ford and Opel offer more affordable options. Volkswagen occupies a significant market share with balanced pricing.

5. **Listing Dates**: The creation dates of listings exhibit variability, with the majority being relatively recent. However, a subset of listings date back several months, indicating prolonged availability.

6. **Registration Years**: Erroneous registration years were filtered out, and the distribution of registration years underscores the prevalence of vehicles registered within the past two decades.

## Implications

The findings gleaned from this analysis carry substantial implications for stakeholders in the used car market. Prospective buyers can better assess the fair market value of vehicles, considering factors such as brand, mileage, and age. Sellers, in turn, can gain insights into competitive pricing strategies.

## Benefits

- Comprehensive Insights: This analysis yields a comprehensive overview of the used car market's characteristics, empowering stakeholders with informed decision-making capabilities.
- Enhanced Transparency: By cleaning the dataset and removing anomalies, the analysis ensures data accuracy, reinforcing the integrity of the insights.
